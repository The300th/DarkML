# DarkML
Use of Machine Learning for finding a mapping between dark-matter-only simulations and hydrodinamic simulations. We have populated 3 dark-matter-only simulations with baryon properties: the Multidark Planck simualtion (MDPL2)  box_size=1 Gpc h^{-1} and the UNIT simulation box_size = 1Gpc h^{-1} with 2048^{3} and 4096^{3} particles. We have uploaded csv files containing the generated data and also the trained XGBoost model for the user's convenience.
