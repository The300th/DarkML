# DarkML
Use of Machine Learning for finding a mapping between dark-matter-only simulations and hydrodinamic simulations. We have populated 3 dark-matter-only simulations with baryon properties: the Multidark Planck simualtion (MDPL2)  box_size=1 Gpc h^{-1} and the UNIT simulation box_size = 1Gpc h^{-1}  with 2048^{3} (UNITSIM2048) and 4096^{3} (UNITSIM4096) particles. We have uploaded csv files containing the generated data and also the trained XGBoost model for the user's convenience. 

## Baryon Catalogs
We have generated baryon catalogs for the three DM-only simulations listed above. Below, we provide a link to download the link of the catalogs.
